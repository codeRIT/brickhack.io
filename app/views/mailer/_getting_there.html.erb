<h3>Getting There - Busses</h3>
<p>Buses are being provided to Buffalo, Binghamton, Cornell, and Oswego. If you are eligible, you will be given an option to sign up on the <a href="https://brickhack.io/rsvp">RSVP form</a>. <strong>You must RSVP and sign up for the bus to guarantee a seat!</strong></p>
<p>If you live near these areas but don't see the bus sign-up option, please email <a href="mailto:travel@brickhack.io">travel@brickhack.io</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting There - Driving</h3>
<p>If there isn't a bus available for your school, don't fret! We encourage you to carpool with others from your school.</p>
<p><strong>A car pool list</strong> is available at the below link. If you're driving and would be open to taking a few more attendees with you, please list yourself!</p>

<p>For those driving, you can put <em>1 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, NY 14623</em> into your GPS. This will take you to the main RIT entrance, which will include a large and a small roundabout. Take the first exit off the small roundabout and park in the lot to your left (E-Lot).</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately we are unable to provide travel reimbursements due to university policy.</em></p>
