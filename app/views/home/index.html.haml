    .split-four
      .column
        %h2 What is a hackathon?
        %p
          Great question! A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone with an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in CS!
        %p
          MLH has a great list of related questions over at <a href="https://mlh.io/faq">mlh.io/faq</a>.

      .column
        %h2 I've never been to a hackathon before, can I still apply?
        %p Of course you can! Our attendees will range from first-timers to veteran hackers. Saddle up to a new framework, refresh a stale project, or just hang out and enjoy the diverse company.

      .column
        %h2 I don't live near Rochester - can I still come?
        %p Definitely. We invite hackers from all over the US and Canada to join us for our annual event!
