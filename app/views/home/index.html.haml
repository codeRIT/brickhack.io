    %h1 FAQ

    .split-four
      .column
        %h2 What is a hackathon?
        %p
          Great question! A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone with an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in CS!
        %p
          MLH has a great list of related questions over at <a href="https://mlh.io/faq">mlh.io/faq</a>.

      .column
        %h2 How am I supposed to get there?
        %p If you live in the Rochester, NY area, you’re good to go. If not, we still welcome you! Some schools will have a bus provided; see below. Unfortunately we are unable to provide travel reimbursements. If you have any questions, contact <a href="mailto:travel@coderit.org" class="orange">travel@codeRIT.org</a>.

      .column
        %h2 What should I bring?
        %p Bring yourself, a photo ID, clothes, toiletries, a sleeping bag/blanket, your hacker setup and maybe an idea or two.

      .column
        %h2 Who can participate in BrickHack?
        %p Anyone who is currently enrolled as a student or has graduated within the last 12 months can attend! If you don't fit that description, you're welcome to attend as a mentor or volunteer!
        %p All attendees must be 18 years or older to attend. Proof of your age may be requested on the day of the event.

      .column
        %h2 When does registration close?
        %p Acceptance notification will start being sent out February 8th. Applications submitted afterwards will be waitlisted.

      .column
        %h2 How much does this cost?
        %p Zero. Zip. Nada. Attending BrickHack is free, and we'll be providing plenty of food and swag throughout the weekend!

      .column
        %h2 I've never been to a hackathon before, can I still apply?
        %p Of course you can! Our attendees will range from first-timers to veteran hackers. Saddle up to a new framework, refresh a stale project, or just hang out and enjoy the diverse company.

      .column
        %h2 I don't live near Rochester - can I still come?
        %p Definitely. We invite hackers from all over the US and Canada to join us for our annual event!

      .column
        %h2 Are busses being provided?
        %p Busses are being provided to a number of schools. We'll email you after you register if a bus is available!

      .column
        %h2 Do I need a team to join?
        %p While teams are often recommended and sometimes more fun, they're not required. Feel free to invite your friends. Teams are a max of 4 people.

      .column
        %h2 Do RIT students need to apply?
        %p Yes, RIT students need to apply just like everyone else.

      .column
        %h2 Can high schoolers join?
        %p Anyone that fits the age requirements can apply, even high schoolers.

      .column
        %h2 When will I know if I got in?
        %p Acceptance notifications will start being sent out January 16th on a rolling basis.

      .column
        %h2 Should I bring my own bricks?
        %p We've got you covered.

      .column
